## Resubmitting for Evaluation  

This notebook has been re-run and saved to ensure all outputs are visible. The previous submission may not have executed all cells before being saved and pushed to GitHub, which could have caused discrepancies in the graderâ€™s review.  

### Addressing Previous Feedback  
- **Summary Statistics DataFrame:** The original output appeared correct, but points were deducted for incompleteness. This resubmission ensures all metrics are fully organized and displayed as expected.  
- **Pie Charts (Gender Distribution):** These charts were included in the original notebook but may not have been visible due to an execution issue. This submission confirms their presence.  
- **Box Plot & Max Timepoints:** The previous submission contained all required data, but deductions were made regarding completeness. This resubmission ensures all treatment groups and timepoints are properly displayed.  

All required calculations and visualizations have been checked and confirmed. If any elements appear missing, please ensure the notebook is fully executed before review.
