## Resubmitting for evaluation
I may have forgotten to run all cells before saving and pushing this notebook to Github so that may have accounted for discrepancies between the expected outputs

# Each critique that resulted in point deductions

  However, the creation of the summary statistics DataFrame is incomplete, resulting in a slight deduction. Ensure the final DataFrame is fully organized to present all calculated metrics cohesively.
  -- Summary Statistics should have been perfect or near flawless based on the output I was getting

  In the Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts section... However, the pie charts for the gender distribution were missing.
  -- I definitely included these pie charts. So, again, the grader not seeing these had to have been because I didn't save the notebook after running the cells

  However, retrieving maximum timepoints and generating the box plot with complete data for all treatment groups could be improved.
  -- Again, my outputs indicated all the max timepoints and complete data for the groups so I hope this new submission manifests this
